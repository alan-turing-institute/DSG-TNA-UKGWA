# Repository of the Turing Data Study Group: Discovering topics and trends in the UK Government Web Archive (UKGWA)

This repository contains all code written during [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) [Data Study Group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/collaborate-turing/data-study-groups) 'Discovering topics and trends in the UK Government Web Archive (UKGWA)', in collaboration with [The National Archives](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/) (TNA). This repository is a companion to the ~~published~~(coming) report of the same name.

While the code helps getting a better understanding of the implementations of the ideas described in the report, it is important to remember that it was written in a handful of days (and nights ðŸ˜´) by a group of people that never met before. All errors are due to the lack of sleep, while all cool ideas have emerged thanks to the support (and the free â˜•) of the Turing.
