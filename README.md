# Repository of the DSG: Discovering topics and trends in the UK Government Web Archive

This repository contains all code written during the Data Study Group focused on discovering topics and trends in the UK Government  Web  Archive (UKGWA), in collaboration with The National Archives (TNA).

While the code helps getting a better understanding of the implementations of the ideas described in the paper, it is important to remember that it was written in a handful of days (and nights ðŸ˜´) by a group of people that never met before. All errors are due to the lack of sleep, while all cool ideas have emerged thanks to the support (and the free â˜•) of the Turing.
